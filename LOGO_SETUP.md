# Logo Setup Instructions

To add the NK Divanshu Builders logo:

1. Copy your logo file (NK_Divanshu_Builders_Logo.jpeg) to the `public` folder
2. Rename it to `logo.jpg`
3. The logo will automatically appear in the header and footer

The logo is already configured to display at:

- Header: 60px height
- Footer: 40px height

Both will maintain aspect ratio automatically.
